# Core Concepts

BreezeAPI is built around a few core concepts that make API development fast and type-safe:

- [File-based Routing](./file-based-routing): Organize your API by placing files in specific folders. Each protocol (HTTP, WebSocket, TCP, tRPC) uses a specific file name and location.
- [Handlers & Context](./handlers-context): Each handler receives a context object with request data, params, and helpers.
- [Middleware](./middleware): Use global or per-route middleware to add logic before/after your handlers.
- [Validation & Type Safety](./validation-type-safety): Use Zod schemas and TypeScript for safe, validated APIs.
